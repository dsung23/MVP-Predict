# NBA MVP Prediction Model


Advanced data science project building a predictive model for NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. Analyzes 30+ years of NBA statistics to predict MVP vote shares using ensemble machine learning methods, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.8096.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: 50+ statistical predictors including traditional and advanced metrics
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Ensemble voting regressor (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Hist Gradient Boosting)
- **Performance Metrics**: Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.8096 for ranking accuracy

## ðŸ“Š Technical Stack

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Web Scraping**: Automated data extraction from Basketball Reference
- **Machine Learning**: Ensemble methods (Voting Regressor with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Hist Gradient Boosting)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus, VORP

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

### Data Collection & Processing
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 30+ years of NBA data (1991-2025)
- **Data Quality**: Missing value handling, outlier detection, validation
- **Feature Engineering**: Added relative performance ratios (PTS_T, AST_R, STL_R, BLK_R, 3P_R)

### Feature Engineering
The model incorporates 50+ predictive features:

**Traditional Statistics:** Points, Rebounds, Assists, Field Goal %, Games played
**Advanced Metrics:** Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus, VORP
**Team Performance:** Win/Loss record, offensive/defensive ratings
**Relative Performance:** Year-normalized ratios for points, assists, steals, blocks, 3-pointers

### Machine Learning Approach
- **Algorithm**: Ensemble Voting Regressor combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Hist Gradient Boosting
- **Training Strategy**: Time-based cross-validation (1996-2024) with rolling window approach
- **Evaluation**: Mean Average Precision (MAP) for ranking accuracy
- **Model Performance**: Achieved MAP of 0.8096 across 29 years of backtesting

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

### Model Capabilities
- Successfully predicts MVP vote shares and player rankings with 80.96% accuracy
- Identifies key statistical factors influencing MVP voting
- Evaluates ranking accuracy using Mean Average Precision (MAP)
- Demonstrates strong performance in recent years (MAP of 0.8698 for 2010-2024)

### Technical Achievements
- **Data Scale**: 5.9MB comprehensive dataset with 30+ years of NBA history
- **Feature Complexity**: 50+ engineered features combining traditional and advanced metrics
- **Model Robustness**: Ensemble voting regressor improves accuracy and reduces overfitting
- **Advanced Evaluation**: MAP of 0.8096 with strong recent performance (0.8698 for 2010-2024)
