- **Feature Engineering**: Added relative performance ratios (PTS_T, AST_R, STL_R, BLK_R, 3P_R)

### Feature Engineering
The model incorporates 50+ predictive features:

**Traditional Statistics:** Points, Rebounds, Assists, Field Goal %, Games played
**Advanced Metrics:** Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus, VORP
**Team Performance:** Win/Loss record, offensive/defensive ratings
**Relative Performance:** Year-normalized ratios for points, assists, steals, blocks, 3-pointers

### Machine Learning Approach
- **Primary Algorithm**: Ensemble Voting Regressor combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Hist Gradient Boosting
- **Baseline Model**: HistGradientBoosting Regressor for quick demonstrations
- **Training Strategy**: Time-based cross-validation (1996-2025) with rolling window approach
- **Evaluation**: Mean Average Precision (MAP) for ranking accuracy
- **Model Performance**: Achieved MAP of 0.8127 across 30 years of backtesting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter tqdm 
```

### Running the Project
Execute `machine_learning_v2.ipynb` for predictions

**Note**: The notebook includes both individual models and an ensemble approach. 
The HistGradientBoosting model provides excellent performance (MAP: 0.7914) around 3
 minutes for quick demonstrations. The ensemble Voting Regressor 
achieves slightly higher accuracy (MAP: 0.8127) and also takes around 3 minutes.

## Model Performance Over Time

The model demonstrates consistent performance across different eras:
- **Overall Performance (1996-2025)**: MAP of 0.8127
- **Recent Performance (2019-2025)**: MAP of 0.8965 (+10.3% improvement)
- **Peak Performance**: 2003 season achieved perfect 1.000 MAP
- **Most Challenging**: 2005 season with 0.4208 MAP

## Key Insights

- **Perfect Top 3 Prediction**: Model correctly predicted the top 4 MVP finishers for 2025 in correct order
- **Ranking Accuracy**: Successfully identifies MVP candidates with high precision
- **Feature Importance**: Advanced metrics (PER, Win Shares, VORP) are crucial predictors
- **Team Performance**: Team winning percentage significantly influences MVP voting patterns
